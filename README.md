## What?
The iec-60908 standard (also known as the Red Book) describes how
[optical discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc) known
as [Compact discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc) work.
The information in this document is very abstract, and represents a
very real challenge to anyone trying to make heads or tails of how
the data is organized on the disc, and even less how to generate
said data stream.

This repository is a collection of research notes and tools, aiming
at grounding the mathematics behind all this into actionable code
and knowledge. [Disc rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_rot)
is a very real issue, and threatens preservation of our culture and
knowledge, and having better tools to not only read, but recreate
the information from such medium is a step forward in archival
efforts.
